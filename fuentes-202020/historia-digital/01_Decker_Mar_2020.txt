ABSTRACT\
Digital History is a relatively new sub-discipline within the academy. Understanding the nature of digital history, especially whence its core principles have evolved and how key practitioners have applied digital tools in generating historical knowledge, is the focus of this work. If Digital History is to grow into a more meaningful part of the historical discourse, we must make certain changes within academic culture and adapt to longer term technical realities.\
\
KEYWORDS: Digital Humanities, historiography, theory\
It is true that from time to time a dissenter would say that things had gone too far, that newcomers were too aggressive or presumptuous, and that history after all was an art and not a science.1\
\
The Chronicle of Higher Education recently published a debate on the Digital Humanities, beginning with Timothy Brennan\'92s \'93The Digital-Humanities Bust.\'942 In the piece, Brennan noted that the application of algorithms to complex social phenomena has yielded some stunning failures, such as Nate Silver\'92s infamous flop in forecasting the 2016 presidential election. Brennan believes that the Silver problem is part of a broader \'93results crisis\'94 which offers an entr\'e9e into discussions of computing power and its application in the service of humanistic inquiry. Crucially, Brennan argues, the academic \'93discipline\'94 implied by the \'93Digital Humanities\'94 label is \'93 \'85 about an institutional reframing \'85 and ultimately, an epistemology.\'94 This epistemology is not to Brennan\'92s liking, being full of false promise, hyperbole, and opacity while simultaneously devoid of critical thinking, or any kind of thinking. Equally damningly, he asserts that Digital Humanities practitioners confuse more information with knowledge. Brennan pessimistically concludes, \'93Rather than a revolution, the digital humanities is a wedge separating the humanities from its reason to exist \'96 namely, to think against prevailing norms.\'943\
\
Though practiced by professional historians for decades, Digital History retains a modest presence in the broader arena of Digital Humanities and is noteworthy in its absence or limited place in recent major Digital Humanities publications.4 Nor has Digital History rooted itself in the academy among the professional guild of historians. In part the slow embrace of Digital History reflects concerns given voice in Brennan\'92s piece. The charges laid at the feet of Digital Humanities (and Digital History by extension) are similar to those made of quantitative- and social science historians during the culture-wars of the 1960s. In some ways, the circle has never been squared. For examples, social science historians have their own professional association and, among its ranks, the number of those practicing quantitative methods is dwindling. Many historians bristle when \'93data\'94 are mentioned as objects of analysis; they work with \'93sources\'94 or \'93evidence.\'94 The quantitative element of Digital History is repellent to many historians and out of fashion in most fields of history, which rely in the main on case studies and qualitative approaches of interpretation. Thus, the \'93computational turn\'94 embodied in Digital Humanities is already beyond the traditional norms of practice within the study of history.\
\
One would struggle to find quantitatively focused history departments outside of Cal Tech, where economic history reliant on quantification is prominent. The poor reception of computational methods in history is likely to change only slowly, as the current generation of graduate students is most likely to be taught as their advisors were taught, via close-reading of a relatively narrow corpus of texts, an emphasis on context, and through hands-on work in archives. In the end, these approaches are crafted and communicated through a rather strict, narrative presentation.\
\
To date, the acknowledged organizational heart of the guild of professional historians, the American Historical Association (AHA), has minimal assistance available for departments and individual scholars who wish to develop and defend tenure and promotion criteria based on digital methods, though the 2015 publication of \'93Guidelines for the Professional Evaluation of Digital Scholarship by Historians\'94 is a step in the right direction.5 However, like their Digital Humanities peers (where the issuance of The Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0 has apparently had minimal impact), the network of digital historians who mingle online in places like H-Digital-History on h-net.org, have not produced a shared values- or vision statement critical for the success and advancement of their cause, and their colleagues in academic departments generally lack well-developed, clear standards for peer-evaluation of digital dossiers leading to promotion and tenure.6 Digital History conferences are also a rarity.7 Digital historians must navigate a career labyrinth designed in an analog era whose layout has largely failed to adapt to the reality that most public information, and even the majority of scholarship, is produced and consumed by digital means, either through journal repositories such as JSTOR, ebooks, exclusively online peer-reviewed journals, or digitized primary source materials. Given this fact, the slothful pace of the academy to adapt is somewhat surprising and the lack of Digital History projects recognized on their merits reveals a fissure in the field and a threat to the vitality of both traditional and Digital History.\
\
Quantitative history and digital history: a brief genealogy\
From the 1940s through the 1970s, some historians embraced new philosophies and approaches which supported efforts to break new ground and add dimensions to the study of history, a movement that at least one historian traced to the influence of Frederick Jackson Turner during his career at the University of Wisconsin and Harvard from 1885 to 1924.8 What marked the new political historians was a methodology rather than a focus on any geographic or thematic area of history.9 An essential element of Digital History is its quantitative nature, expressed in computer manipulation of source material. The use of computer software employing algorithms and able to analyze massive stores of data is a new wrinkle to an approach that has been part and parcel of the quantitative method in history since the 1950s. Then, as with today\'92s digital historians, quantitative historians were met with a mix of enthusiastic discipleship and skeptical naysay.\
\
Scholars like Lee Benson, whose 1957 \'93Research Problems in American Historiography\'94 decried the impressionistic research then prevailing in the study of US political history, sounded the claxon demanding more precision and a more \'93scientific\'94 history. Benson forcefully argued that historians previously lacked the systematic data of voting behavior over time and space as well as the means to analyze these. With proper collection of data and application of statistical methods, appropriate hypotheses could be posited, tested, and their validity established \'93so that experts will attach a substantial degree of credence to it.\'9410 Economic history was particularly in the van of the so-called \'93New History,\'94 with ground-breaking and controversial studies such as the 1958 \'93The Economics of Slavery in the Antebellum South\'94 by Alfred H. Conrad and John R. Meyer, whose essay applied quantitative methods to data to underscore the profitability of slavery in the Antebellum South.11\
\
Many historians resisted what they saw as the threat that quantification posed, namely a reductionist tendency. By the 1930s, professional historians in North America had embraced a certain degree of complexity in their narratives and generally acknowledged multi-causation in their conclusions. Because of the dogmatic stance taken by some acolytes of the \'93New History\'94 as well as the nature of quantified history itself \'96 which favored the presentation of data and numerical results as much as narrative argument \'96 traditional historians felt varying degrees of discomfort. Though not entirely fair, charges of determinism or simplistic monocausal explanations were laid at the feet of quantifying historians. These critical views can be seen in famous and oft-quoted remarks by Arthur Schlesinger Jr. who, during his role as Special Assistant to President John F. Kennedy, wrote that \'93Until the omnipotence of determinism can be demonstrated by infallibility of prediction and control, one must surely stick with the provable facts and accept the existence of intractable elements in experience which may well \'85 continue to defy quantification.\'9412\
\
While many historians have employed statistical or other quantitative methods, perhaps the best-known example of this scholarship is Fogel and Engerman\'92s Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery (1974).13 Using statistical methods and new computing technology, Fogel and Engerman marshaled and analyzed thousands of documents, a scale and scope of work with little precedent. That the authors concluded that slavery was \'96 contrary to the views of many \'96 both productive and efficient, and that some economic benefits existed for slaves, made the book controversial. The authors expressly opposed views that slavery was unprofitable and severe which, in their view, \'93 \'85 enthroned a respectable and acceptable sociological justification\'94 of the inferiority of black Americans.14 Despite Fogel and Engerman\'92s clear and emphatic statements and narrative approach to discussing their conclusions, Time on the Cross generated considerable disagreement. Many critics focused on the methodology of the project and apparently ignored much of what Fogel and Engerman actually argued in their narrative presentation. In the end, the maelstrom around the work took its toll: \'93After Time on the Cross, advocates of numerical analysis and computing technology found themselves on the defensive.\'9415\
\
Analyses based on quantification are most compelling where large datasets lend themselves to numeric investigation. It is therefore unsurprising that much Digital History has focused on the early modern and modern periods. After the invention of the printing press in the fifteenth century, the production and preservation of text across Europe burgeoned. Now decades-long efforts in library digitization have brought new life to thousands of early modern books, many of which had been largely forgotten and inaccessible.16 The abundance of textual material and its geographical and chronological spread lends itself to the creation of digital archives and the opportunity to investigate historical trends using computer tools.\
\
History and the digital revolution\
During the same decades in which the new political history was being contested, scholars with similar interests in quantification began working with computers. The Index Thomisticusan, begun in 1946 by Roberto Busa, an Italian Jesuit priest, is widely considered the first Digital Humanities project. The Index aimed to produce a machine tool for text searching the voluminous writings of the medieval theologian Thomas Aquinas (1225\'9674), whose works occupy over 20,000 pages in print. Busa began a quest to find machines that could bring his ambitious project to fruition and, in 1949, found them at the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Eventually, Busa came to conceive of a project in what he called \'93Hermeneutic informatics,\'94 focused on the mechanical translation of languages and inspired by a 1966 report by the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee undertaken by the National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency.17 The convergent interests of \'93Big Science\'94 and its corporate and government sponsors is of course hardly surprising in the context of the Cold War.18\
\
Busa\'92s index would be realized through the use of cardpunch, tabulating, and sorting machines patented by Herman Hollerith but owned by IBM.19 The collaboration between the priest and IBM would span more than 60 years and require the use of a veritable army of programmers, engineers, and cardpunch technicians. However, the limits of the technology available at the project\'92s start led Busa to envision a final punchcard archive holding 13 million cards in a file 1.2 m high, 90 m long, and weighing 500 metric tons; that is, until, \'93in His mercy, around 1955, God led men to invent magnetic tapes.\'9420 When Busa wrote the foreword to A companion to Digital Humanities (2004), he informed his audience with a hint of triumph that \'93The work now consists of 1.36 GB of data, compressed with the Hufmann method, on one single disk.\'9421 As he neared his life\'92s end and reflected on his project and the computing changes that made possible the success of the Index, Busa exclaimed \'93I am full of amazement at the developments since then; they are enormously greater and better than I could imagine. Digitus Dei est hic! The finger of God is here.\'9422 For one not of Busa\'92s generation, who lived his formative years before the nuclear age, the almost child-like faith in technology and progress he expresses is jarring and, as critics of Digital Humanities like Brennan are quick to point out, misguided. Skeptics might well take stock of the rather rapid evolution of the technology employed in service of the Index Thomisticus and be deterred, but others note that multiple Digital Humanities projects have evolved and survived through decades of hardware and software changes.23\
\
What is digital history?\
What is Digital History as practiced today? Dougles Seerfeldt and William G. Thomas attempted to answer this question in 2009 when they stated \'93digital history might be understood broadly as an approach to examining and representing the past that works with the new communication technologies of the computer, the internet network, and software systems.\'9424 More than a decade ago, Daniel Cohen and Roy Rosenzweig enumerated seven attributes of digital media and networks \'93that potentially allow us to do things better: capacity, accessibility, flexibility, diversity, manipulability, interactivity, and hypertextuality (or nonlinearity).\'9425 The Digital History approach frequently includes digital processing and storage of oral histories, images, or text. Further prominent features of the Digital History approach are heavy reliance on textual search and analysis, especially of \'93Big Data\'94 (which can be roughly characterized for humanists as a body of evidence too massive and/or complex for an individual to read). Topic modeling, used extensively in digital literary studies, offers stimulating and valuable ways to query and understand potential word links in text.26 Recognition of the vital role of place in shaping human history has sparked inquiry through materials ranging from historical maps to landscape studies via GIS analysis, which are further tools of the digital historian.\
\
While it is necessary, perhaps even good, to take such a catholic view of Digital History pursuits, there is a certain weakness as well. Disciplines by their nature have boundaries, and without such fences, Digital History cannot really develop the sorts of professional norms and functions that define other history fields. In this way, Digital History seems, in the short and intermediate term, at any rate, destined to be an enhancement, rather than a replacement in any one area of study.\
\
The lack of disciplinary boundaries produced and protected by the historians\'92 guild and academic codification has practical and self-reinforcing consequences, including a state of professional nonbeing. Disciplinary norms also pose serious challenges to the longevity of Digital History, which is scarcely recognized as a sub-discipline of History by the academic community that acts as gatekeeper and safeguard of historical methods. There are currently no PhD degree programs offering Digital History field concentrations, though there are MA Digital History degree programs.27 Though a number of PhD programs emphasize Digital History in some fashion and many more accept work on digital topics, there is no PhD in \'93Digital History.\'94 Where the stakes and expectations are lower, a greater proportion of digital content is widely accepted, as websites with accompanying methodological and contextual \'93companion\'94 theses are not unusual.28 Given how we have just characterized Digital History as a general approach and set of practices and tools, this is unsurprising. At the University of Washington, for instance, one is informed that \'93the UW Department of History is on the cutting edge of historical scholarship,\'94 but Digital History does not appear as an area of major concentration within the graduate program.29 Instead, various individuals and centers involving multiple scholars and nodes of support on campus foster and sustain interest in Digital History. This is similarly the case in other programs where Digital History is emphasized, as at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and George Mason University. Both institutions require major fields in traditional history \'96 such as European or American history \'96 and Digital History seems to be a lens taken to a traditional subset of historical inquiries.\
\
While the lack of Digital History academic specialization credentialed at the PhD level is understandable, is there a way things could be done differently? Unfortunately, in the current environment of higher education, when the humanities are in deep crises, university funding in tight supply, and history PhD programs under pressure to cut credits and/or complete graduates in as timely fashion as possible, it is difficult to see how Digital History can find space within the curriculum. Indeed, the skills required to pursue Digital History projects range from basic computer literacy, like the ability to use a scanner and manipulate pdfs, to much greater technical challenges, such as master cinema production techniques and software, web development and web design, not to mention a bevy of skills and toolsets employing digital graphic arts techniques, database design and population, and the like. The high barrier to entry for many professional-quality scholarly projects can thus sometimes be intimidating.\
\
Thus, like other Digital Humanities pursuits, the successful implementation of Digital History endeavors often requires extensive collaboration that, ideally, plays to the strengths of individual researchers. In this way, the multifaceted nature of Digital Humanities projects frequently render them powerful pedagogical tools and appealing entr\'e9es to more traditional fields of history for Generation Y and Generation Z students, who are digital natives and generally find interaction with digital materials to be both natural and necessary; during their lifetime, Generation Z students have more minutes of media exposure than any other activity, apart from sleeping.30 While undergraduates may not grasp the finer points of Renaissance or East Asian history, they may well have the web app skills to fill a vital need in the team approach that most successful Digital History projects require.\
\
Digital History is history in public and in some sense a kind of public history. The ability to reach a large audience is key. Online dissemination typically allows one to reach an audience many times larger than afforded by publication of a print monograph. Moreover, the reader (or user) experience is enhanced through the plasticity of the online environment: these add to the public nature, or what historians Shawn Graham, Ian Milligan, and Scott Weingart call the \'93outward looking face\'94 of history.31 In the end, the online environment permits engagement with larger groups of people than traditional print means.\
\
Much like the quantitative history projects noted above, Digital History works generally aim to be holistic in their presentation of scholarship, making not only the questions, narratives, and conclusions of history available to audiences, but also the data collected, curated, and cleaned along the way. This openness distinguishes Digital History from more traditional forms of historical pursuits, as transparency is intended to foster discussion, criticism, and a \'93look under the hood\'94 of any and every project. This methodology is obviously quite different from the deeply personal and sometimes opaque works of most historians, who collect their sources, often in little accessed archives where they may well be the only person in their lifetime to ever view their source texts.\
\
Digital History in practice\
In what sorts of projects have Digital Historians engaged? A selection of publications (online and in traditional analog format) can provide one a sense of the pursuits of some, although it is not the purpose of this article to undertake a thorough review of Digital History projects, though such a review is needed. As can be seen in this briefest of introductions, the varieties of Digital History are quite expansive and, in many senses, are possible because they can be freed from the spatial, linear, and binary constraints of the book. While I must apologize for the crudeness of the following classifications, it has been most convenient to discuss a selection (rather random and in no way intended to be exhaustive, but rather qualitatively illustrative) of projects by Digital Historians in American history and world history education, scholarship, and theory.32\
\
The good news is that digital projects have been completed or are in progress in nearly all areas of historical research. Less good news is that there is, as yet, no single clearinghouse where digital history projects can permanently reside and be easily accessed through one convenient web portal. Among the classics in the field is The Valley of the Shadow: Two Communities in the American Civil War (http://valley.lib.virginia.edu/) which was among the earliest and most influential Digital History projects. Launched by William G. Thomas III and Edward L. Ayers in 1993, The Valley of the Shadow provided digitized material from Augusta County, Virginia, and Franklin County, Pennsylvania, from 1859 to 1870. The project brought together and made accessible a vast quantity of information, including newspaper documents, historical photos and maps, census and tax records, letters and diaries, and other pieces of historical information. The project has been immensely successful, not only in the recognition it received as being among the first of its kind, but for its professional coding, presentation, and management. Crucially, Thomas and Ayers were able to move beyond the creation of an archive and offer original analysis based upon the digitization of sources by producing an online article, \'93The Differences Slavery Made: A Close Analysis of Two Communities.\'9433 Around the same time, in 2004 and ten years after the launch of The Valley of the Shadow, Ayers found it a \'93major disappointment [that] relatively few scholars have undertaken projects the size and scope of the Valley of the Shadow.\'9434\
\
Indeed, while today hundreds of Digital History projects populate the web, few have generated the attention or reached the audience of The Valley of the Shadow. But there have been some notable projects, such as The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database (http://www.slavevoyages.org/), the largest and most complete archive on the trans-Atlantic slave trade currently available, with information on more than 35,000 unique voyages undertaken from 1514 to 1866. The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database also has a long history, being launched in 1993, around the same time as The Valley of the Shadow, and it too was funded and supported by multiple funding bodies and institutions of higher education.35 Mapping American Social Movements in the 20th Century, hosted by the History Department at the University of Washington, uses interactive maps to allow us to \'93understand patterns of influence and endurance\'94 in radical, civil rights, labor, and women\'92s movements, among others.36 Railroads and the Making of Modern America (http://railroads.unl.edu/) is another project by William G. Thomas IIII (of The Valley of the Shadow), this time in collaboration with Richard Healey of the University of Portsmouth, UK, and Ian Cottingham, a software engineer at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Railroads \'93collects and makes available a wide array of materials documenting the social effects of the railroad and the transformation of the United States to modern ideas, institutions, and practices in the nineteenth century.\'9437 The American Yawp (www.americanyawp.com) is offered in partnership with Stanford University Press by editors Joseph Locke and Ben Wright, who created a \'93collaboratively built, open American history textbook\'94 intended to \'93help guide students in their encounter with American history.\'9438 Interestingly, Stanford University Press now offers a print-edition of The American Yawp, which shows not only the dogged persistence of print, but also the quite conservative nature of historical studies and education, in particular. The offering of a hard copy edition also underscores the need to realize profit from such projects to support their long-term viability.\
\
World historians have also contributed immensely via sites such as Datamining with Criminal Intent39 which, alongside many other worthy projects, employs advanced data mining techniques in rendering analysis of the history of criminality based on the nearly 200,000 records of criminal trials held in London\'92s central criminal court from 1674 to 1913.40 Eric Johnson created the Kazan 19th c. Project, which began as \'93Mapping Kazan\'94 and \'93explored the demographics and built environment of the Russian city of Kazan in the early nineteenth century.\'9441 Since 1991, the Wilson Center has supported and produced the Cold War International History Project (https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/theme/cold-war-history), which has grown to include more than thirty archival collections and is among the most important global repositories of information on Cold War history. While the Cold War features frequently in pre-university curricula in the United States, other Digital History projects have been built in response to the perceived lack of awareness and curricular space in other areas of history, among them the Rethinking the Region: New Approaches to 9\'9612 U.S. Curriculum on the Middle East and North Africa (http://www.teach-mena.org/), launched in 2013, as well as the Our Shared Past in the Mediterranean: A World History Curriculum Project for Educators, whose aim is to \'93encourage new approaches to world history curriculum and curricular content design\'94 based on the premise that the \'93notion of many of the categories used to frame and teach world history \'96 civilizations, nations, religions, and regions \'96 occlude as much as they reveal,\'94 though the site does use the region of the Mediterranean as a framework to globalize history. Perhaps most ambitious of all is Patrick Manning\'92s Collaborative for Historical Information and Analysis, which aims to create a \'93world-historical data resource,\'94 a task as challenging as it is necessary.\
\
In the realm of theory, digital historians have also had considerable voice and have dealt with topics as diverse as ontology, hermeneutics, and semiotics in history. David Staley\'92s work, Brain, Mind, and Internet addresses concerns that the internet harms our brains through an examination of the deep history of coupled cognition in which our brain employs external symbolic storage, the paradigm of which for centuries has been the printed book, as the hand-copied book before it. In the case of the internet, the coupling has traditionally been viewed in the context of the brain:book dichotomy, a paradigm that Staley attempts to escape through a deep historical lens as well as via construction of a futurist framework which, like history, is a meaning-making activity.42 John Durham Peters, in a thought-provoking and important essay, challenges the way historians view loss and deletion in the context of valuation and memory and brings considerable comfort in assuring us of the annihilation of most text, even as he wonders how we hold on to what we have: \'93to be sure, most everything written does not survive; most of the Dead Sea scrolls exist as nothing but minute fragments (or don\'92t exist at all).\'9443 More recently, Niels Br\'fcgger attacked the problem of the web as an archive and how historians manage the problem through conceptualizing five analytical web strata to help us as historians with the web and historians of the web.44 As internet use grows, the web archive expands toward infinity at an astonishing pace; in the past two years, 90% of the data in the world was generated.45\
\
This brief discussion of Digital History projects has offered but an intellectual amuse-bouche to an impressive body of historical knowledge currently online; hundreds more examples would be required to illustrate the vivacity and dynamism of Digital History in its current state. However, as practiced in the US, and over much of Europe where Digital History has become a serious intellectual pursuit, it is clear that in the main Digital History projects are mostly public-facing enterprises. This should not surprise and has already been noted above. However, it reinforces the problems of academic acceptance and sustainability. As tensions between professionally curated or generated information and analysis continues, and as the academy requires the print monograph, which most departments still do, the Gordion knot still holds. As noted above, significant challenges in Digital History remain unresolved and have long been noted. More than a decade ago Ayers noted that \'93Relatively few scholars have undertaken projects the size and scope of the Valley of the Shadow. Libraries are carrying on remarkable undertakings in digitization and tool building, but is hard for individual scholars to conceive of large digital projects.\'9446 While scholars might conceive of large projects, the difficulty is how to carry such ambitions to fruition. During my time as a professor at the large state R1university, I have built on two previous experiences in Digital Humanities by initiating a large-scale project using coins as economic proxies for the medieval period.47 Using only student helpers, I have assembled a database of more than 30,000 individual coins which offer key markers of space and time. However, without institutional or grant support, the project can be nothing more than a sideline doomed for the dustbin. I have no doubt many other projects live and die in such a fashion, perhaps as interesting academic exercises in which the participants learn something, but ultimately having short existences and no broader public impact.\
\
As I have noted above, for support to grow and for Digital History to thrive, there needs to be a fundamental shift in the discipline\'92s culture. If Digital History is to continue to develop and even to thrive, what measures are needed? Among the clearest need is financial investment. Projects like The Valley of the Shadow, which received support from IBM, the University of Virginia, and the NEH, among others, need considerable funds to sustain them. While the NEH has offered a bevy of Digital Humanities programs in recent years, the funding rate is quite low and (based on personal experience), reviewer perception of what a Digital Humanities project is rather narrow. Especially muted in the projects from North America is GIS, which has suffered from the high technical threshold required to enter this computational sphere. Another sphere of historical studies, cultural heritage, is also emphasized much more in Europe than in North America, likely in large part due to the fact that in Europe, archeology is a humanities subject, while in North America archeology tends to be categorized as a social science. Disciplinary silos bedevil, even in the digital, mold-busting cybersphere.\
\
Digital History and accessibility\
Beyond the ability to include the bulk of the data one has used to build historical analysis, Digital History projects are usually disseminated online, thus they offer different means of expression and more diverse possibilities for audience interaction than that afforded by traditional print histories. Websites are far more accessible than print media. While an academic monograph may have an initial print run of 200\'96600 copies, and perhaps an ebook version which would be easier to obtain, the trifecta of specialized writing, lack of public awareness, and cost are sufficient barriers to entry to the general public when it comes to the knowledge generated by most historians. Digital History is most often disseminated freely online and readership could easily exceed the 200\'96600 mark in one month. If the work has an accessible archive component useable by a broad audience (e.g. the K-12 teaching community), a Digital History site may log more readership in one week than a print monograph would over its entire lifespan.\
\
This online aspect has other marked implications. Whether it is a research blog or a research project website, room is usually provided for immediate commentary or feedback, regardless of the individual audience member\'92s level of expertise. This happens all the time with historians in the wild, of course, but with Digital History the peculiarities of web-influenced behaviors may lead to a set of interactions very different from those which would transpire between any two individuals in person. Since anyone can put up a website about history without transiting peer-review or other professional hurdles, the online dimension to Digital History creates a leveling effect, where distinguishing markers are the quality of method, the curation and presentation of data, and the quality of analysis. These are indicators adopted from the analog world of historians, not from practitioners of history online. Without the training to value scholarly Digital History sites, which may not compete in terms of visual and verbal style with non-academic sites, there is a serious risk that the general public will misuse the materials they are given, a risk that is less obvious in the analog world of history. At the same time, the benefits of raising awareness and bringing attention to accepted standards of academic practice and professionalism would seem to outweigh the potential downsides of open access.\
\
Online open access, being free to the end user, means a much broader potential audience, but content development and delivery is not free. Universities generally maintain scholarly resources produced by their research faculty, but not always. Sometimes the demands for server space or other infrastructure to support the research lack any obvious owner or manager, as individual scholars usually possess neither the technical, nor financial wherewithal to sustain complex web environments. Thankfully, most academic libraries have stepped into the breach to provide the needed resources, but these also come at a cost and the long-term prospects for preservation and access have long been noted and debated.48 Access and preservation are not the same, and thoughtful planning and institutional support are needed to ensure their viability.49\
\
Researchers seek assurances that the work they produce, whether in curating digital archives, or publishing their results, will find long-lasting homes that are both secure and easily available. The standard for this is, of course, the printed book. Swift developments in media should not, however, deter historians from Digital History projects. As Daniel Paul O\'92Donnell has argued, technology ages faster than information and the viable preservation and transmission of Digital Humanities knowledge resides in the use of appropriate tools and community support.50 The fact that scholars have been working on Digital Humanities projects for more than seven decades and that some, like the Index Thomisticus, remain accessible and functional are causes for celebration and should encourage others to continue in the footsteps of the pioneers who led the way.\
\
Questions about the longevity of digital publication are important, especially for historians, many of whom are used to handling or accessing documents that have survived and remained accessible through generations or even centuries. The confidence gap between current data management capabilities and those desirable for archival longevity is significant. Not long ago, historians were working on digital projects and disseminating their work on CD-ROM, yet the shift away from CD-ROM in favor of the internet and other storage media happened quite suddenly. Today most personal computers have no drives capable of reading CD-ROMs, though one can still readily find hardware that can.\
\
Nonetheless, the problems of obsolescence and data access are both acute and unresolved. Calls, too, for more durable forms of digital storage have not gone unheeded. Just as fire or flood destroy physical archives, virtual archives are threatened by data corruption or loss due to other factors. Of course, data corruption or loss affects all computer users, not just historians. Failure of access due to obsolescence of software and hardware are naturally causes for concern. Researchers from the University of Southampton recently engineered quartz data coins utilizing technology developed by Hitachi and Kyoto University. Each data coin could hold up to 360 TB of data and, so it is claimed, survive for billions of years \'96 assertions that have understandably generated significant popular interest.51 As with so many experimental and emergent technologies, the first solution rarely wins the day, as the war over standards involves complex supply-side and demand-side actors and activities.52\

Just as analog archives suffered from loss in natural catastrophe and through physical rot, age, and neglect in many instances, their inaccessibility was nonetheless often their salvation. Digital archives, often free to access, open, and in plain sight, are taken for granted, consulted, perhaps cited, and then forgotten. It was the closed nature of the book that inspired many involved in to re-envision the durable utopian myth of the Universal Library in digital form, in which the world of the book resided in a computer open to the global public.53 Open access would thus allow a revolution in knowledge. The hardware and software used to house and access these new historical sources, though, are in some ways more fragile than their predecessor, the printed text. The utopian dream of the Universal Library has once again receded, especially in light of the retreat of Google\'92s Library, which collapsed from the lofty heights of notional universal digitized open library to \'93universal bookstore\'94 under the weight of copyright law and advocacy.54\
\
In their vital position between scholar and reader or user, library curators and data management are too little discussed, nor sufficiently drawn to engage in the conversation among Digital History practitioners. Unlike most individually or even university managed websites, which we all know are too often plagued by relict web DNA, broken links, and lost materials, the role of trained, technically savvy area-specialist librarians is, I would argue, more important than ever. It is depressing, for instance, to consider the number of web addresses cited here that will not function five years after the publication of this article. How can we historians countenance such ephemeral citation and warehousing of knowledge?\
\
Since 2003, when historian Roy Rosenzweig grappled with digital data loss through his analysis of the website Bert is Evil!, the satirical web creation of Dino Ignacio which fell victim to reactions to 9/11, the problem has not been resolved.55 As someone who has developed several Digital History projects over my career, especially classroom projects, I would like to be able to collaborate with librarians and be assured they can help me put my fingers on the material we produced today or ten years ago, even if I have no intent on releasing student work into the wide open wild of the web. Thus communication, data curation, storage strategies, and accessibility must continue to be addressed, preferably in the design phase of the project, and librarians have been assessing the prospects in a serious and sustained way for more than two decades, even before Margaret Hedstrom announced the digital as a \'93bomb\'94 in the library.56 As libraries are now often the default permanent homes of Digital History scholarship, scholars can take comfort that charges of ephemerality can be answered somewhat; on the crudest level of preservation, publishing a Digital History scholarly website is no different than cataloging and depositing your monograph in the stacks. Challenges remain, but the development of international standards of access, a series of best practices in data management, and metadata standardization hold promise for a much more sustainable future.57 In many cases, our friends in allied fields have done much to prepare the advance; all important standards governing metadata are increasingly available, and the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a massive leap forward for accessibility and the promise of durable digital scholarship.\
\
In certain ways, digital media cannot yet rival the simple codex devised of late antique genius \'96 for example in certain aspects of ease of use and durability. While an analog book cannot be easily consulted by fifteen readers simultaneously, nor discovered in a Google search, its physical nature and staying power seem much more certain safeguards than those we are currently able to offer of our digital work. The word processor in which I am typing this article did not exist thirty years ago, nor the operating system on my PC, nor the web service currently hosting the draft version of it, neither the web browser via which I will receive reviewer comments. What are the odds that XML or Omeka or Apple will be around in 1,600 years, much less our individual magnetic or solid-state drives? While the codex is familiar and still a solid, trusted, and comforting object in the lives of most people living in the developed world, this is changing and will continue to change. The rise of web-based knowledge acquisition and explosion of ebooks perhaps hearkens the slow trot to a codex-less future. And yet, the doom of the printed book remains far from certain, given that book sales over the last five years have been on the increase.58\
\
Publication, though, has changed a lot since the 1990s digital revolution, and pressures from academic funding, the requirements of academic publishing, and the evolution of technologies and public preference have all played a role in how we view, manage, and ingest text. With three-quarters of Americans online daily, and a quarter of Americans online constantly, the limited role of Digital History in education and scholarship within the academy seems out of balance.59 In the case of the current transformations underway in information and knowledge, it is difficult to see where the sure path lies, and perhaps we can all be forgiven if we feel as though we have ended up in the midst of The Inheritors.60\
\
Conclusion\
Digital Historians have already demonstrated time and again the value of what we do and the fact that history practiced online and beyond the book can be hugely beneficial to scholarship, students, and the broader public. Digital History is transparent and accessible in a way that traditional methods and dissemination simply do not allow. The methods employed positively invite theoretical and methodological challenge, as we would expect (and need) in the case of a paradigm shift so large as outgrowing the confines of text. As with all collaborative approaches, Digital History projects need broad support from a variety of disciplines, institutions, and funders beyond those that presently exist. Given the current state of the humanities, it seems more likely that Digital History will continue to be practiced by a dedicated network of professionals sharing similar foci, looking for new pathways of historical exploration, and making outsized contributions to public awareness and discourses of history, all while staying strangely marginal within their own professional discipline.\
\
More than ever, the historian\'92s craft calls for re-engagement with the tools of Digital History. The increasing use of digitized sources and communication across digital media, the potentialities and pitfalls of the new archive, and the perils to its preservation should all suffice to catalyze a call to action. However, awareness and engagement with the blindspots caused by our dependence on a growing but faulty archive of digitized text through the massive online catalog of the Western print archive, seems to have not gone beyond where it stood when Tim Hitchcock wrote that \'93history as a discipline, largely uninvolved in the production of digital resources and apparently uninterested in changing how it illustrates it scholarship to accommodate the digital, has put its head in the sand and tried to ignore the whole issue.\'9461 What cannot continue is for historians to persist in our use of digital technologies \'93to make our lives easier, while pretending that they do not exist.\'9462\
